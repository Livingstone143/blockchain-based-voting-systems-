# Blockchain-based Voting System

This project implements a blockchain-based voting system that ensures transparency, security, and immutability in the voting process. The system leverages the decentralized nature of blockchain to prevent tampering, fraud, and unauthorized access, making it ideal for digital voting applications.

## Features

- **Decentralized Voting:** Every vote is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.
- **Security:** Votes are securely encrypted and can only be cast by authorized voters.
- **Anonymity:** Voters' identities are protected, ensuring privacy in the voting process.
- **Smart Contracts:** Smart contracts are used to manage voting rules, such as eligibility, voting duration, and result calculation.
- **Transparency:** Anyone can verify the integrity of the election process by inspecting the blockchain.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain Platform:** Ethereum (or any blockchain platform supporting smart contracts)
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity
- **Frontend:** React.js (for the user interface)
- **Backend:** Node.js (for server-side logic and communication with the blockchain)
- **Web3.js:** Library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain from the frontend
- **IPFS (optional):** For storing large data off-chain

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14.x or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Truffle Suite (for smart contract development and testing)
- Ganache (for a personal Ethereum blockchain)

# Installation Guide

1. **Install dependencies:**

   For the backend and frontend:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   For the smart contract:
   ```bash
   cd smart-contract
   npm install
   ```

2. **Setup Ganache:**
   * Install Ganache and start a new Ethereum blockchain instance
   * Configure Truffle to use Ganache by editing `truffle-config.js`

3. **Deploy the smart contract:**

   Deploy the contract to your local Ganache blockchain:
   ```bash
   truffle migrate
   ```

4. **Start the application:**

   For the backend:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   For the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

5. **Access the application:**

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the voting interface.
